# Mikrotik Domain2ListAddress
Python CLI parser to convert a list of domain names to a Mikrotik Address List entry. Useful for creating block lists.
 
This is a WIP project. Suggestions are welcome! :-)

# Usage

Usage is quite forward in CLI:

``` 
python parser.py /path/to/domain_list.txt /path/to/output_file.rsc list_name
```
